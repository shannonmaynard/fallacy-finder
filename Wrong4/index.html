            This is <b>‘Questionable Cause’!</b> Jane thinks that,
            <br>
            because she didn’t listen to the email, she actually
            <br>
            became unlucky and this caused her to have a flat tire.
            <br>
            The truth is probably much more normal, like she ran
            <br>
            over something sharp and punctured a tire. The email
            <br>
            causing her to have a flat tire is very questionable!
