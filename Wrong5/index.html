            This is the <b>‘Bandwagon Fallacy’.</b> Sally has given in to the
            <br>
            opinion of the majority. She assumes that because there are
            <br>
            many people who think her hobby is uncool, it must be true.
            <br>
            So she changes her hobby to what many people consider a
            <br>
            cool hobby. She’s jumped on the bandwagon!
